    <p class="hello">Hi.</p>

    <p>
    I'm a PhD student in computer science advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/~amal/">Amal Ahmed</a> and <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/">Steven Holtzen</a> at Northeastern University.
    My research interests revolve around how programming languages can be used to write more reliable software with less effort, taking into account practical concerns like performance and interactions between multiple languages.
    I'm especially interested in type systems that provide strong guarantees against classes of errors that are difficult to debug, such as those involving effects or memory.
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft in the Azure Quantum team.
    During that time, I contributed to the compiler and language design for Q#, Microsoft's quantum programming language.
    Highlights include leading the switch to Hindley-Milner-based type inference, the switch from statement-based to expression-based syntax, and a complete rewrite of the compiler in Rust, all while maintaining a high degree of backwards compatibility.
